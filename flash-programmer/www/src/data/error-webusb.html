    This browser does not support WebUSB, so you won't be able to use it with your Floopy Drive. Please try a<br>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://caniuse.com/webusb">supported browser</a>.

    Some alternatives exist as well:
    You can install some WebUSB capable browsers as a portable (temporary) solution, if that is preferred. Most WebKit-based browsers should support it.
    The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/henrypp/chrlauncher">chrlauncher</a> Chromium launcher for Windows makes it a snap to retrieve, launch, and cleanly remove Chromium browsers.
    Or, for Chrome without any of the Google nonsense, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium">Ungoogled Chromium</a> for Linux/Mac/Win.
