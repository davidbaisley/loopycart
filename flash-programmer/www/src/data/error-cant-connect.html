<p>Unable to find and connect to a Floopy Drive.</p>
<ul>
    <li>This site may not be permitted to use WebUSB, either by your global settings or this specific site setting.
        A combined security/settings icon should appear to the left of the URL in the URL bar.
        If you can access this, ensure under site permissions, "USB Devices" is set to "Ask", and reload the page if any changes were made.
    </li>
    <li>Check that your global privacy settings allow WebUSB. Look in your browser settings for Privacy and Security &gt; Site Settings &gt; Additional Permissions &gt; USB Devices (chrome://settings/content). Ensure this is set to "Sites can ask to
        connect to USB devices."
    </li>
    <li>The Floopy Drive must be ejected from the Loopy to flash. Inserting into the Loopy will automatically switch it into developer/serial mode.</li>
    <li>Ensure your Floopy Drive is connected: the power LED should be visible through the rear of the cart. If not, try a different USB port or a different USB cable (really!).</li>
    <li>Ensure the device is recognized: look for a "Floopy Drive" in your browser (chrome://usb-internals/) in the devices tab, the Device Manager in Windows, or System Information.app on MacOS under Hardware &gt; USB</li>
</ul>
